## Case 1
The antiplatelet drug - aspirin - reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in some patients but does this benefits outweigh its bleeding harm? A web-based risk calculator was developed to provide clinicians with individualised estimates of the CVD benefit and bleeding harm of aspirin for their patients without established CVD.

## Case 2
The dissimation of research in prognostic risk prediction is not limited to a journal publication. How can we consistently implement models across new and unseen datasets, and further assist validation through consistent model implementation? In response, an R package was developed to enable researchers a means of consistently, efficently, and accurately apply various risk models to their datasets.

## Case 3
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a diagnostic measure of overall heart health and one of the most important prognostic indicators for people with cardiovascular diseases. Currently, clinicians are required to manually review a patientâ€™s echocardiography (ECHO) report to determine their level of LV functioning. Is there a smarter way of extracting information from ECHO reports that is clinically significant? This project adopts a deep learning approach toward building a multi-level classifier for LVEF.
