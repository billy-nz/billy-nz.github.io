## Case 1
The antiplatelet drug aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in some people. The key clinical question is whether there are individuals without established CVD in whom the absolute benefits of aspirin outweigh its absolute harms. A web-based risk calculator was developed to addresses this question by providing an individualised estimate of the number of CVD events avoided and number of major bleeds caused by aspirin.

## Case 2
The dissimation of research in prognostic risk prediction is not limited to a journal publication. How can we consistently implement models across new and unseen datasets, and further assist validation through consistent model implementation? In response, an R package was developed to enable researchers a means of consistently, efficently, and accurately apply various risk models to their datasets.

## Case 3
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a diagnostic measure of overall heart health and one of the most important prognostic indicators for people with CVD. Clinicians are required to manually review a patientâ€™s echocardiography (ECHO) report to determine their level of LV functioning. Is there a smarter way of extracting information from ECHO reports that is clinically significant? This project adopts a deep learning approach toward building a multi-level classifier for LVEF.

## Case 4
Questionnaires developed in Survey Monkey are easily delopyed but difficult to analyse. Additionally, the task of cleaning and processing raw export files can be time-consuming and frustrating undertaking. As such, a web application was developed that offers an end-to-end pipeline; whereby raw data goes in, and report-ready analyses comes out. This style of analytics was implemented using psychometric data gathered from professional athelets.  [See full details.](SportPsychTool/)
