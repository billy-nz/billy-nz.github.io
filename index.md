## Case 1
The antiplatelet drug - aspirin - reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in some patients but does this benefits outweigh its bleeding harm? A web-based risk calculator was developed to provide clinicians with individualised estimates of the CVD benefit and bleeding harm of aspirin for their patients without established CVD.

## Case 2
The dissimation of research in prognostic risk prediction is not limited to a journal publication. Once risk models have been developed and peer-reviewed, it is necessary to consistently implement such models across new and unseen datasets. Further research involving model validation also require consistent model implementation. As such, an R package was developed to enable researchers a means of consistently, efficently, and accurately apply various risk models to their datasets. [See Github Repo.](PredictRiskScores/)

## Case 3
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a diagnostic measure of overall heart health and one of the most important prognostic indicators for people with cardiovascular diseases. Currently, clinicians are required to manually review a patientâ€™s echocardiography (ECHO) report to determine their level of LV functioning. Several efforts involving rule-based approaches have been made to extract information from ECHO reports but none have adopted a deep learning approach toward building a multi-level classifier.
